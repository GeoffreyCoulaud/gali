# Brag's UI

## First mockups
These images were made to give a rough idea of what the UI should look like.  
I used [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn/) to make these mockups, although I 
don't recommend using it since the project seems to be inactive for quite some 
months.  
I took inspiration from [Lutris](https://github.com/lutris/lutris).

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Games grid, default view</th>
            <th>Scanning view, replacing the default view</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="mockup1.png"></td>
            <td><img src="mockup2.png"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Game info popover with a start button</th>
            <th>Game info with a stop and kill button</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="mockup3.png"></td>
            <td><img src="mockup4.png"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</details>

## Second mockups
These mockups were made using [Figma](https://figma.com).  
They are higher fidelity, but not final yet.  
I tried to better visualize the different app states.  
You can take a look at the project file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/YcTUGVEvarxrgpq01VkieN/Brag-launcher---Second-mockups).

## TODO
* ✅ Use XML to describe the UI
* ✅ Grid with a fixed number of columns
* ✅ Create the view change for scanning
* ✅ Make app startup trigger a library scan
* ✅ Make scan button trigger a library scan
* ✅ Bind libary content to the game grid
* ✅ Bind grid element selection to the revealer (visible state + content)
* Create the popup menus
	* Source filtering (+ installed filtering)
	* Settings
* Bind the grid resize to its option
* HeaderBar buttons toggle the corresponding menus
* ✅ Bind the game life cycle buttons to their game methods
* Bind source filtering to the game grid
* Support light theme
* Detect images for all sources (and maybe change preferred aspect ratio)

## Help and workarounds

### The game grid 
After quite some time, I've figured out how to make the cover images expand to 
fill the grid's width. This was thanks to **Marco Melorio** 
[on Gnome's discourse forum](https://discourse.gnome.org/t/how-to-make-an-image-fill-the-width-of-a-box-and-keep-aspect-ratio/7980/6?u=geoffreycoulaud).
I'll pass the details but it almost made me ditch the fixed number of columns 
design choice.


### The event loop
At the moment, `node-gtk` doesn't have a way to make GLib's event loop and 
Node's run simultaneously. This broke my UI code in some places.  
On the dedicated discord server, `NathanaelA#3774` found a solution and gave an 
example that uses a separate UI process and inter process messaging.

<summary>This was our discussion</summary>

NathanaelA:
<blockquote>
`Promises` appear to work fine for me in the GTK3 code as my Webkit browser 
code uses promises and async code and everything works, not sure on GTK4.   
However, one easy way around this issue is to use node-gtk only for the UI.
I had to pivot to this design because I actually needed both a GTK 3 and GTK 4
window open at the same time and that is impossible to do in a single process
(even Python and GJS will error out ).    
Unfortunately I need to access a WebKit occasionally and on my version of
Linux it forces GTK3 to be loaded when it is loaded).   
GTK 4 I used for everything else as it has a much nicer api.   
So my app I now have it built like this:
Node (Primary Process and virtually all logic, NO visual UI from this one, it 
is unaware of GTK)  
 -> (optional) Forked Node (GTK 4) primary app window  
 -> (optional) Forked Node (GTK 3) WebKit window 

It does use a few more megs of memory when I start any of the GTK forks, but 
the primary node instance has no issues with the setTimeout or Promises or 
anything dealing with the message loops as GTK is not running in it.  
And the forked nodes can be open as many times as needed and can be fairly 
dumb as they can directly just send any and all events back to the primary 
node process.

In addition you get real multitasking in some areas as the primary node 
process isn't held up by anything either of the GTK processes are doing. 😉

This is promising (pun intended), I will have to check this more in detail and 
maybe look at some code if you don't mind sharing ?  
I'll gladly pass the "rewrite your app to use another runtime" thing

I haven't released anything of what I'm doing yet.   
Here is the base part that should help you get started:

<pre><code>"use strict";

let child_app = null;
let child_browser = null;

import { fork } from "node:child_process"

console.log("Application Starting");
start_mainView()
start_webView();

function start_webView() {
    child_browser = fork("webview.mjs", [], {
        cwd: "./webview/"        
    });
    child_browser.on("message", (m) => {
        console.log("Child sent message", m);
        handleWebViewMessage(m);
    })
    child_browser.on("close", () => {
        console.log("Child  Quit");
        child_browser = null;
    })    
}

function start_mainView() {
    child_app = fork("mainview.mjs", [], {
        cwd: "./application/",
    });
    child_app.on("message", (m) => {
        console.log("Child sent message", m);
        handle_mainViewMessage(m);
    });
    child_app.on("close", () => {
        console.log("Child Quit"); 
        child_app = null;       
    });
}
</code></pre>

And basically a child is like this (this is the start of my webview app):

<pre><code>"use strict";

import {Application, GTKConfig} from "node-gtk-ui";
const WebKit = GTKConfig.Webkit; // Force loading of WebKit which will force GTK3 (or GTK4 later versions)

// Are we a child?
if (process.channel) {
    process.on("message", (m) => {
        switch (m.type) {
            case 'quit': process.exit(0); break;
            case 'status': process.send({status: 1}); break;
            case '...': // Other messages we want to handle
        }
    });
}
const app = new Application( {width: 800, height: 800, title: "Login"});

let stackLayout = app.document.createElement("div");
app.document.appendChild(stackLayout);
let webview = app.document.createElement("webview");
stackLayout.appendChild(webview);
webview.src = "https://nativescript.tools/";
</code></pre>

</blockquote>
</details>


However, this move to a multi-process app doesn't make as much sense to my use
case, because lots of data would have to be shared between them (the library).  

The solution to my problem was to wrap `app.run()` in a microtask (like 
`setTimeout`).
Commit #31a07ca has this main/view process separation but moving 
forward it's going to be removed since it complexifies the app's architecture
and adds no benefit *for this use case*.
